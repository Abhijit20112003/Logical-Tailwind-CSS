# To Logical Tailwind (Tailwind CSS Logical Properties Transformer)

An online tool to convert Tailwind CSS classes in your components to their logical equivalents for RTL (right-to-left) support and, optionally, full logical properties support using the [Logical Tailwind plugin](https://github.com/stevecochrane/tailwindcss-logical).

Visit the tool: [To Logical Tailwind](https://logical-tailwind-css.vercel.app/)

## Introduction

This project aims to simplify the process of converting Tailwind CSS classes in your components to their logical equivalents for better RTL support and, if needed, comprehensive logical properties support using the Logical Tailwind plugin or Tailwind CSS v3.3+. It requires either Tailwind CSS v3.3 or higher, or the Logical Tailwind plugin in your project.

## Plugin vs. Native Comparison

When it comes to logical CSS properties, you have two options: the Logical Tailwind plugin or the native Tailwind implementation. Here's a comparison to help you choose the right approach for your project:

 - Logical Tailwind Plugin: The Logical Tailwind plugin offers comprehensive support for logical CSS properties. If your project requires full logical    properties   support, this plugin is the recommended choice. You can integrate it into your project and leverage its advanced capabilities.

- Native Tailwind Implementation: The native Tailwind implementation, available from Tailwind CSS v3.3 onwards, primarily focuses on RTL support. If your main  goal is to support RTL languages without the need for full logical properties support, using the native implementation should suffice.
